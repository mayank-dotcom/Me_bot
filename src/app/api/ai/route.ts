## Input Parameters

Here is the chat history so far:
{context}

And here is the user's question:
{question}`
const promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({
  template: Template,
  inputVariables: ["question", "context"],
});

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  temperature: 0.5,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const chain = new LLMChain({
  llm: model,
  prompt: promptTemplate,
});

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { question } = await req.json();

    if (!question) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Missing question in request body" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // Connect to MongoDB
    const client = new MongoClient(MONGODB_URI);
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db("talkingbot");
    const collection = db.collection("chat_histories");

    // Build context from past history
    const chatHistory = await collection.find({}).toArray();
    const context = chatHistory.map(chat =>
      `Human: ${chat.question}\nAI: ${chat.answer}`
    ).join("\n");

    // Get LLM response
    const res = await chain.call({ context, question });
    const answer = res.text;

    // Create audio using OpenAI TTS
    const speech = await openai.audio.speech.create({

      input: answer,
    });
    const buffer = Buffer.from(await speech.arrayBuffer());

    // Save to DB
    await collection.insertOne({ question, answer });

    // Close DB connection
    await client.close();

    // Return audio buffer
